            <div class="child"><p>In 2012, the pair met on SoundCloud and struck up a musical connection, leading Shpresa Lleshaj to travel from Stockholm to Minneapolis to meet Cole Randall in person. They returned to Sweden together and immediately began work as Flora Cash. They were married the next year.</p><p>I like their music because their style is very quiet and comfortable, it has a very Nordic feel and it's very artistic.Their themes often revolve around people's deepest feelings or a social topic.</p></div>

               <div class="child"><p>Lexie LiuChinese singer, rapper and songwriter. Her electronic music was so avant-garde that it was considered to represent a new era. In February 2019, Liu released her Debut EP 2030 In the United States with eight Singles including Outta Time featuring Killy, Love and Run, Hat Trick, and Nada.</p><p>I got to know her through a Chinese rapper show. What I like most about her is her accomplishments as an entertainer in the fashion industry. Her music video production and album covers, as well as some street shots can be seen traces of cyberpunk.</p></div>

               <div class="child"><p>Robin Daniel Skinner (born 15 December 1998), known professionally as Cavetown is an English singer-songwriter, record producer, and YouTuber based in London. His style blends elements of indie rock, indie pop and bedroom pop with mellow, gentle ukulele ballads.</p><p>Every time he collaborates with other artists, he can collide with different sparks. Listening to his songs gives me a dreamy waltz feeling floating in the clouds, which makes people feel particularly happy and comfortable. He has his own brand as well as musicians. I really like the design and style of his clothes. I actually buy quite a few of his products myself.</p></div>

               <div class="child"><p>Over the past decade, Los Angeles producer and young art label owner Tokimonsta has helped define the sound of modern dance and beat music. The secret is that there are no secrets, except for embedding songwriting talent and futuristic melodies into the sparkly mandala sounds of hip-hop instrumental, pop, R&B-soul, HOUSE and IDM.</p><p>I like the idea of electronic recordings in her piece, not noisy but bustling, not crowded but mind-crashing. Her songs are my driving playlist.</p></div>
