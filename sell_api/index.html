        <h1>Movies and Films</h1>
        <h2>that I found worth watching and pondering</h2>
        <br>

        <p>Movies are very important to me. In addition to being a source of entertainment, they brought dreams to me as a child and to many others like me. For a few hours, meet another world and see something through someone else's eyes. Meet another soul, experience other people's obsession, resentment, entanglement, innocence.</p>
        <p>A good movie can give people a deep reflection, draw inferences from one example to choose a more suitable life path, make a meaningful choice for their own; Or a philosophy that provides a rigorous logic that gives a thinking person insight into the world; Or it can make people laugh and forget about the troubles of life. For us art students, film is the transmission of visual effects, providing reference and contribution for our aesthetic appreciation.</p>
